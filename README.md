* If you have git installed, enter the following command in the terminal to download the repository files:

`git clone https://github.com/raiphilibert/frontal_positions.git`

* You can follow instructions here to https://happygitwithr.com to install git.

* Alternatively, you can download all files into a folder on your computer as a zip.

* I recommend that you work within the RProj. rather than in the standalone script file. It will make it easier with the relative path.
